# DreamGaussian

This repository contains a minimal implementation of DreamGaussian. The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/dreamgaussian/dreamgaussian).

It is based on the first stage of the DreamGaussian pipeline, which optimizes the Gaussian Splatting data, then visualizes it using the custom [model3dgs gradio component](https://pypi.org/project/gradio-model3dgs/), which is based on [gsplat.js](https://github.com/dylanebert/gsplat.js/tree/main).

A space from the original DreamGaussian authors featuring the full pipeline can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jiawei011/dreamgaussian).
